#A Dark Journey
The main character of A Dark Journey started out as a Wheel of Time Role Playing character at [Dragonmount.com](http://dragonmount.com). I loved the character so much that I converted her to an original world creation. While many of the character elements have been changed because they do not fit into a "real world" fictional city, the character that is the basis is the same. The fundamental concept of the end character that I loved remains in tact.

##World Lore
There is much about this world that needs to be documented for consistency in the pieces that are derived from these notes. Information about the different Races, Terminology and specific Locations are all found in the world lore section of this site.

##Characters
All characters have their own stories that you may or may not see in the pieces that are derived from this world. Here you can find all the characters created no matter how little or big they seem in the story.

##Derivatives
Iâ€™ve started keeping some writing here as well.  They are all set in this world, mostly from the point of view of my main character, but sometimes they are from other points of view.
