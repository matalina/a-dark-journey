#The Phone Call
It was the early morning on the first of September that everything changed. Looking back on it now I see the foreshadowing of the times to come. There was a thunderstorm over the ocean. I watched as it came left the New York City horizon. It was a beautiful sight really. My pale reflection was the only thing marring the view in the plate glass window. My family gathered behind me. There were five in total, all but one was male and family was what they were though in technical terms they were my herd, my food.

Unlike most vampires I did not hunt my food. That was dangerous for me to do, or at least it had been when I'd been set free from my training. The memory has faded and I only recall bits and pieces of the actual time frame. But if I had been alive now as a fledgling vampire, I would not be living afterwards. The irony has it that I would have been sent after myself; for that is my job, I hunt rogue vampires for The Council. My life should have ended the day The Council found out about my actions. But I had gotten my problem under control thanks to Tony.

Among other things Tony helped me begin to gather a willing supply of blood which became known as a herd over the years. Tony and his father, Francesco covered up my mistake by masking the town I had slaughtered and saving the one poor little girl I had not finished off. And by saving I do not mean returning her to her former glory as a human. Francesco did the unthinkable for his kind. He turned the young one into a vampire, and as payment he made me promise to tend to the girl and promise to never speak the truth of her creation. Primeval vampires are forbidden to create vampires of the nearly dead. It was a long standing war between factions of Primeval vampires.

Ryan Elliott was standing beside me as I was lost in my own thoughts. He gave me a smile that was playful and disappointed at the same time. I smiled back at him. Ryan was one of the first two humans Tony had helped me recruit. He and his sister Mia meant a lot to me. Ryan tried to distract me from my thoughts, "I tried to startle you. But you just weren't here."

I gave him a look that said he shouldn't have been surprised and he laughed. Behind us we could hear Larry began his typical joke. "Three vampires walk into a blood bar. The first two order 2 glasses of blood and the third one orders a glass of boiling water. The bartender thinks that it’s kind of weird, but doesn’t say anything — he just gives them their drinks. The next day, the three vampires walk into the bar and order the same thing, two glasses of blood and a glass of boiling water. The bartender still thinks it’s weird but doesn’t say anything, he doesn’t want to be that vampire’s next victim. But when it happened on the third day, the bartender couldn’t help but ask why. . . 'Okay, I know that the three of you are vampires, so why do you two order glasses of blood but you always get a glass of boiling water?' The third vampire pulls out a used tampon and says, 'I like to make tea!'"

I groaned at the joke, not only was it tasteless it was not true. Everyone else gave Larry a mock groan of disgust except for Allison. She laughed so hard she nearly fell out of her chair. But her laughter caught short when she looked at me watching her in the plate glass window. She started to stammer but I interrupted her, "It's fine." She relaxed visibly, but she still watched me cautiously.

Allison was the newest to our group and she was the easiest to offend. I don't know why she signed on to this. Maybe it was the money, or just the fact that she can spend a lifetime with Larry. She clearly had the hots for him.

The other three, Doc, Terry and Jack came over to the window to join Ryan and myself. They didn't say anything as they watched the storm in the distance. The room was tense except for the two chatting on the couch behind us. We had been in New York too long. The storm only made it that much more ominous.

A cell phone rang. Everyone except me searched their pockets for their phones to make sure it was not them that was ringing. The five at the window looked around confused, it wasn't one of theirs. It took Allison several seconds before she realized it had been the little red flip phone she carried in her purse. It was MY phone. My phone never rang!

Allison stared at the phone. Ryan snatched it from her hands and flipped it open to answer. "Il Cane LLC, this is Ryan how can I help you?" his voice was tinged with laughter.

The static filled voice asked, "Is Cari there?" Even with the static it was easy to recognize the soft silky voice Aurora Dejesus, one of the European Council member.

"Yes, ma’am, she is, but you can tell me." Ryan was confident and firm with his response. He knew I hated talking on the phone or using any electronic device for that matter.

"Okay, We are in Dangdburgh, she needs to come immediately." After a pause she continued, "How long will it take for you to get here." Aurora could have said many things, but she said We, with the emphasis on the W. The whole Council was in the same place at the same time. That was a cause for concern.

Ryan laughed, "Cari can be there in seconds, but she’d be without food and protection. None of us like Shadow traveling." Traveling through the Shadows was a lost talent for most vampires, but my creation allowed for so many things to be possible. It was disorienting for humans to travel through the Shadows with me, most of my friends vomited upon arrival, we didn’t do it often.

"Fine, Fine, how long?" Aurora was annoyed and frustrated, you could hear it in her voice.

Ryan asked Allison, "How long would it take us to get to Dangdburgh?"

Allison flipped through her notebook. Allison was my personal assistant, she was in control of almost everything. "It will take us a full day to drive there, less if Larry drives most of the way." She giggled. Larry liked fast cars and he drove every car like they were fast.

Ryan smiled at the joke and told Aurora, "We can be there tomorrow around this time."

You could hear voices on the other side of the phone, Aurora was conferring with someone. When she came back her voice had changed to eager happiness, "Good, I can’t wait to see her." And she hung up the phone.

Ryan turned to me with a grim grin. "We are going to Dangdburgh it seems."

It took longer than normal to get our gear together and packed in the RV we owned. We had been in New York much longer than we usually spend in any given town, you could tell. Things were neatly hung in the closets, folded in the drawers. Even my weapons were placed neatly under blankets in the drawers. We had to be wary with the swords and daggers I carried. While not essentially illegal, they were dangerous and the cleaning staff didn't always realize that they were real. Ryan was the only other person in the family that carried bladed weapons.

Larry] and Doc carried handguns. They were licensed in all 50 states under various pseudonyms. They also happened to be licensed for their professions. Larry is a lawyer. He handles all my legal business. He has for the past 35 years. And Doc is a doctor as his name suggests. Doc has been with me for 32 years.

All my family have a job to do outside of being my food. Allison as previously mentioned is my personal assistant, she handles scheduling feedings, our trips. She handles just about everything you can think of. Including handling the needs of my estate in Dangdburgh and the villa in Rome, Italy. She's done an excellent job these past 20 years.

Jack is a computer programmer, or so we tell people anyway. Jack is a computer hacker. I saved Jack from being sent to jail by helping him disappear back in the 70's when he was caught robbing a bank. He's since learned to do things with electronics that people only wish they could. He is only suppose to use his talents for creating flawless identities, but I think he tests his luck on occasion.

Living for as long as I have someone to manage the funds accumulated over the years has been necessary. Terry has been with me the longest, around 37 years if I remember correctly. He's a stock broker, and a damn fine one too. He and Larry put together three companies to ferry money back and forth from. Plasma Fund is a legit finance company that Terry heads up, Ryan's play on "Blood Bank". He says we make loads on interest alone. I leave it to him. Before Dawn Academy which is a glorified night school. It's main goal is to provide late night classes for vampires wanting to learn new things. The scholarships and donations stay strictly with in its own financial circle, we don't profit from it. The final company Terry handles is a front runner in illegal operations if the humans knew what it really was. In the human world the company is an arbitration consultancy. In my world it is an assassin for hire. Ryan thought it would be funny to use my nick name as the company name, Il Cane LLC

Ryan and Mia are special cases. Ryan's main job is to be a bodyguard. Sometimes he is my bodyguard, protecting me from others. Most of the time is is protecting others from me. Ryan has no external job other than training. He trains daily so that he can fulfill his only real obligation - to kill me if I go rogue again. He takes his job seriously, and despite being human there is only one person who is more capable than he is. Ryan actually started training Ant before Ant came into his full power a vampire. Ant is my living vampire son, a lesser primeval. His father doesn't know he was born.

Mia stays at home at my estate in Dangdburg where it is safe. She would have been diagnosed as having Asperger's Syndrome, but when she was born they thought she was possessed by demons. I saved her from burning at the stake, her brother and she pledged their loyalty to me until the ends of time.

A knock at the door knocked me out of my thoughts. The person on the other side didn't wait for an answer as they walked in. Ryan smiled. "You aren't done yet?" He laughed. "I'd think you'd have been done first."

He started to help me pack things away in whatever luggage we had that was free. "Distant thoughts again?"

"Just thinking about everyone. Going to Dangdburgh is going to be a shock to the system. Did you call Mia?" I finished packing the closet away and zipped the suitcase up before turning to Ryan.

"I did. She's in a flurry of getting things ready." He laughed, "She didn't like the fact that the council was in town, she said and I quote 'The house is a mess'".

I shook my head, "That's our Mia."

When everything was loaded into the RV and we were all set to go, Terry started the drive first. He was a more cautious driver by far, and he actually liked driving in the big city in this monster of a vehicle. Larry would take over once we were on the highway outside of New York.
