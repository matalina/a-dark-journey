##Summarized History
Born November 15, 1098 to a blacksmith and seamstress

At age 5 a fire started from the forge. Her father rushed her outside and ran back in for his wife, however the house fell and they burnt alive. (_Note: The smell of burning flesh makes Cari nauseous and refuses to eat any cooked meat._)

Her aunt was newly married but took her in anyway. Her uncle, Theodore Giovanni, was a not so nice man but whom loved his wife and the child he’d thusly adopted. He taught her everything he knew.

**Insert rape & prostitution**

At the age of 16, her uncle tested her mettle. He sent her after a foe and had her take care of him from beginning to end – finding and then killing him. She passed his test and he used her for many more killings.

Around her 29th birthday Salvador Einor found her and befriended the family watching her and hiring her for his own deeds.

Salvador kidnapped Cari and carried her away to the Vampire Council where they embraced her in an unprecedented manor. The 10 council members provided a sample of their own blood and the combination was given to Cari in the ceremony for the Embracing. Cari was of all of them but none of them. She would become Il Cane, The Hound. The thing that they would send after those who needed to be taken care of.

Each of the 10 council members trained Cari in their ways for 5 years while keeping her under lock and key with a supply of food. She wasn’t allowed to hunt except when out on a mission.

**Insert Summary of the 50 years**

After having been trained by each member she was allowed to stake her own claims but coming when called and needed and she obeyed. (1177)

After having been let out on her own, Cari attempted to hunt as her sires had. Cari went crazy with a blood lust they’d never seen before. Francesco Giovanni and his son Antonio (Tony) found her and covered up the massacre. 

Tony helped Cari find Mia and Ryan Elliott whom became her Chevalier and constant food supply.  Cari found others over the years to accompany them as well.  In total she had at least six humans around her at all times.

The council found out about the massacre two years after the massacre.  The council forbit Tony and Cari any contact from that point forward. (1179)

Cari found out she was pregnant with Tony and her son, Anthony Giovanni II. He was born July 4, 1180.  She called him Ant and Tony was never told.

*****

With the New World becoming popular, 3 of the council members were to travel there, Cari would go with them, but first another was needed for Europe, they searched for 10 years to find a replacement in  Valence Dilanti, and they trained him for the next 50 years before allowing the 3 council members and Cari to leave for the new world in 1752.

The New World was ripe with activity and Cari took jobs and helped the Council establish their rule.

When the surge of Mafia and other organized crime in the late 1800′s Cari was hired by many humans to do their dirty work. She moved from New York to Chicago and other places where organized crime was high.

(1825) One of Cari’s vampire marks was ravaging a town and Cari found him just as he killed a family. Before he reached the young boy, Cari killed him. Taking pity on the boy she took him in and raised him. Alistair Johnathan Rosedale eventually fell in love with Cari and she embraced him against the wish of the council to save his life. (1846) But they did not kill him, finding that he might be useful, though he never really proved to be in the time he was with Cari.

In 1846 Cari made Breeana a lesser Chevalier.

Alistair left Cari after 41 years to find his own way.  Cari released Breeana from her service and she went with Alistair.
